<p>We are always running, running to achieve the things that life haven't endowed upon us. Every one want to buy the best in market. Enjoying the finest quality wine or having the best cuisine available. All you need is a magic wand that can bring all these to you. You run day and night to have this wand at hand. Fortunately or unfortunately, some have it and some don't. People calls it by a variety of names, but I like to call it by its most popular name — Money.</p>

<p>One can write volumes about money and about its worth/futility. It is a great subject, but I am not endeavoring to write about it. Instead I am concentrating on the Run, that constitutes most of our lives and still don't bring much of a change to it. True that many of us becomes millionaires and others don't. But then, not everyone can become millionaires in terms on money. But sure they can be, in terms of Happiness.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I had to visit a doctor, whose hospital is situated at one side of a hill. This hospital was owned by the doctor I was about to consult. The road was broken and the hospital was situated at the other side of the hill from the road. I was tensed that I have to walk a lot to get there. So I took a cab. It was supposed to ease me up. But it didn't.</p>

<p>I was worried about me wasting a lot of time. I should have built something, or read something for the exams. But I didn't. I was wasting time and it really tightened me up. The cab was moving through one of the most beautiful places in the locality. But I never paid attention to it. The scenery was beautiful and it was supposed to ease me up. But it didn't.</p>

<p>I looked around the hospital. Definitely not a great place to keep an hospital. Away from the city and not easily accessible. But then he was a dermatologist. He needn't handle any emergencies. He owned the hospital and he needed on the patients who come there for consultation. He would have made a lots of money, had the hospital been in the city. But he chose to stay here. He was happy with what he got. Happiness is not bought, but made.</p>

<p>But that does n't look like a feasible business model. Does it?</p>

<p>I decided to test it out. I can't afford to wait. I am running out of time. I need to get back to college as soon as possible. May be I would test it out later.</p>

<p>Then the realization struck me. My problem was not the exams or the things I need to make. Neither was I running out of time. I was keeping on running without thinking about where it is taking me. I thought keeping on running will take me to great distances, but so did the hamster in the wheel.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to let the cab go. I decided to walk back to the main road. It was beginning to get dark. But I couldn't resist the urge. But I knew that too much of contemplation will take me nowhere. So I started walking before my mind to form a decision.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see the extent of details I missed and even the flowers on the road side looked sumptuous to me. I could feel the fresh air gushing into my lungs and myself feeling releived. The splendid greens was delight to my eyes and even the sound of the stream flowing much far from me was a pleasure to listen to.</p>

<p>Forget the crappy editing, it was the best evening I have had for a long time. The loneliness was enticing the spicy food complimeted it. I was lost in the feeling and ended up taking some photos. I normally don't use my phone for photography, but the beauty of the place was so enticing that I ended up taking a lot of pics in an attempt to make the time freeze at that instant so that I can savor it for a long time.</p>

<p>May be it was just another roadside shop and the beauty I associated had more to do with my mood then. But what I learnt was the power small decisions can bring in your life. I decided to walk instead of the routine cab and I was rewarded with a beautiful evening. Salvation lies in the most perfunctory stuff around us. But we overlook them, fitting our eyes to the most remote target we could imagine of.</p>
