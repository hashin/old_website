<p>Each one of us in on the run,the run to achieve stuff that life haven't endowed upon us. Every one wants to buy the best in market. Enjoy the finest quality wine and having the best cuisine possible. All you need is a magic wand that can bring all these to you at once. You run day and night to have this wand at hand, which could be waved at will. Fortunately or unfortunately, some have it and some don't. People calls it by a variety of names, but I would go by the most popular one — Money.</p>

<p>One can write volumes about money and about its worth/futility. It is a great subject, but I am not endeavoring to write on it. Instead I am concentrating on the Run, that constitutes most of our lives and still don't bring much of a change to it. True that many of us become millionaires and others don't. But then, not everyone can become millionaires in terms on money. But sure they can be, in terms of Happiness.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I had to visit a doctor, whose hospital is situated at one side of a hill. This hospital was owned by the doctor I was about to consult. The road was broken and the hospital was situated at the other side of the hill from the road. I was not happy that I had to walk a lot to get there. So I took a cab. It was supposed to ease me up. But it didn't.</p>

<p>I was worried about me wasting a lot of time. The time  I should have spent building something, or reading for the exams. I was wasting time and it tightened me up. The cab was moving through one of the most beautiful places in the locality. But I never paid attention to it. The scenery was beautiful and had I paid some attention, I would have been relaxed. But I didn't.</p>

<p>I looked around the hospital. Definitely not a great place to build an hospital. Away from the city and not easily accessible. But then, he was a dermatologist. He need not handle any emergencies. He ran the hospital solely for the patients who would come there for consultation. It would be have been more profitable if he moved to some prime spot near the city. But he chose to stay. He was an happy man, and happiness is not bought, but made.</p>

<p>But that does n't look like a feasible business model. Does it?</p>

<p>I decided to test it out. I couldn't afford to wait. I was running out of time. I need to get back to college as soon as possible. May be I would test it out later. Again, I went back to my forte - procastination.</p>

<p>Then the realization struck me. My problem was not the exams or the things I needed to build. Neither was I running out of time. I was keeping on running without stopping to bother about the direction. I thought keeping on running will take me to great distances, but what I didn't realize was that the same thought kept the hamster turning the wheel perpetually.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to let the cab go. I decided to walk back to the main road. The dusk was beginning to sink in. But I couldn't resist the urge. I knew from experience that too much of contemplation will take me no where. So I started walking before my mind could fetter out a reason for why I should avoid walking.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see the granduer of details I missed while on the cab. Even the tiny flowers on the road side looked sumptuous to me. I could feel the fresh air gushing into my lungs and myself feeling releived without any particular effort. The splendid greens was a feast to my eyes and even the sound of the stream flowing much far away from me was a pleasure to listen to.</p>

<p>Forget the crappy editing, it was the best evening I have had for quite a long time. The loneliness was enticing with the spicy food complimeting it. I was lost in the feeling and ended up taking some photos. Normally, I hesitate to use my phone for photography. But the scenic beauty of the place was irresistible and I ended up taking a lot of pics in an attempt to make the time freeze at that instant so that I can savor it for a long time.One cannot say that it was great idea, considering the quality of pics. But I felt really good clicking them. I believe that these little allowances you give to yourselves can improve our lives dramatically.</p>

<p>May be it was just another roadside shop and the beauty I could associate with it had more to do with my mood then. But what I learnt was the extent of change some most trivial things can bring in to your life. My comparitively benign decision to walk instead of the routine cab rewarded me with a beautiful evening. Salvation lies in the most perfunctory stuff around us. But we overlook them, fitting our eyes to the most remote target we could imagine of.</p>

<p>If we tune our eyes to see the subtle, we will find happiness. For the lord lies in the subtle, at least a certified Quantum mechanic would agree. And indeed, it is a great lesson to learn.</p>]]></description><link>http://www.blog.hashin.me/seeing-what-we-dont-see-normally/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5d0d425b-c9e4-4560-a495-e83c31b376f1</guid><category><![CDATA[life]]></category><category><![CDATA[travel]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Hashin Jithu]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 18 Sep 2014 17:39:18 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
